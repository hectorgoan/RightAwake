# RightAwake
A (very) simple macOS app that prevents the system to sleep (or even invoke the screensaver) if the context menu is opened <small>aka the last mouse button clicked is the right one</small>



## MVP
- âœ… Detect left / right click and update menu bar icon accordingly 
- Enable the hability to turn on / off the "listening"
- Enable the hability to turn on / off the system sleep
