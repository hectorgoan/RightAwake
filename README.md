# RightAwake
A (very) simple macOS app that prevents the system to sleep (or even invoke the screensaver) if a context menu is opened (<small>a.k.a. the last mouse button clicked is the right one</small>)



## MVP
- âœ… Detect left / right click and update menu bar icon accordingly 
- Enable the hability to turn on / off the "listening"
- Enable the hability to turn on / off the system sleep
